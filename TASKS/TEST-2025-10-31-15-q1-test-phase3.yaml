    root_cause_analysis:
      problem: "Subprocess-based tests don't contribute to coverage"
      explanation: |
        Most tests use subprocess.run() to execute scripts as external
        processes. Coverage.py cannot track code execution in subprocesses
        unless specifically configured with multiprocessing support.

      test_patterns:
        subprocess_tests:
          count: "~700+ tests"
          pattern: "subprocess.run(['python', 'scripts/tool.py'])"
          value: "Integration testing - tools work correctly"
          limitation: "No coverage contribution"

        import_based_tests:
          count: "~60 tests"
          pattern: "from scripts.module import function"
          value: "Unit testing with coverage"
          coverage: "33 lines (0.18%)"

  key_discoveries:
    1_test_strategy_limitation:
      finding: "Subprocess tests validate integration, not code coverage"
      impact: "754 passing tests but 0.18% coverage"
      lesson: "Different test types serve different purposes"

    2_performance_success:
      finding: "Parallel execution provides 2.3x speedup"
      impact: "Full suite runs in 22.74s (vs 60s+ sequential)"
      value: "Feasible for CI/CD integration"

    3_test_quality_vs_coverage:
      finding: "High test count != high coverage for subprocess tests"
      insight: "965 tests validate tool functionality well"
      tradeoff: "Integration tests vs unit tests serve different goals"
