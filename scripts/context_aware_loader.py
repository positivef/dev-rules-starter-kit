Context-Aware Constitutional Loader - Plaesy/cc-sdd pattern

Based on: Plaesy context-aware system + cc-sdd auto-detection
Purpose: Auto-detect project context and load relevant constitutional articles
Evidence: Plaesy production usage (Trust 2.4 → ideas only)

Pattern:
  Plaesy → Context detection → Automatic article loading

Our Implementation:
  Project analysis → Confidence scoring → Selective validation
