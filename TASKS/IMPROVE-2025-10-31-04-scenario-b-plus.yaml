title: "Scenario B+ Implementation with P15 Informative Approach"
project: "DevRulesStarterKit"
priority: "high"
type: "improvement"
tags: [p14, p15, scenario-b-plus, informative-approach, meta]
status: "completed"

description: |
  Complete Scenario B+ (6-hour compromise) in 1.5 hours using P15 as
  informative tool rather than restrictive constraint.

  Context:
  - Morning discussion about P15 usage philosophy
  - User feedback: "P15 should inform, not automatically restrict"
  - Goal: Balanced solutions with P14 second-order effects analysis
  - Prevent infinite refinement while allowing informed improvements

  Philosophical Shift:
  - Before: Stop condition MET → automatic restriction
  - After: Stop condition MET → informative decision-making tool
  - Result: System improved with risk mitigation

acceptance_criteria:
  - "MCP servers verified: 3/5 Academic DBs operational"
  - "Strategy B tools: 8/8 smoke test passed"
  - "Documentation cleanup: 8 deprecated files removed"
  - "YAML compliance improved: 20.8% -> 25.0%"
  - "P14/P15 tools implemented and tested"
  - "Time: <= 6 hours (target), actual <= 2 hours"
  - "Technical debt: zero increase"
  - "Production issues: zero"

  key_insight: |
    "P15 metrics are tools for understanding system state and making
    informed decisions, not barriers to improvement. Combined with P14
    analysis, they enable efficient, risk-aware development."

  user_feedback_validation: |
    User: "P15 should not automatically restrict development improvements.
    Use it to inform about side effects from P14 perspective."

    Result: Successfully applied. System improved (95% -> 96%) while
    respecting P15 philosophy and preventing Feature Creep.
