## P14: Second-Order Effects Analysis (Innovation Safety)

**Purpose**: Predict and mitigate unintended consequences of changes

### Risk Assessment

- [ ] **Technical Risks**: Complexity increase, sync issues, performance degradation?
- [ ] **Operational Risks**: Monitoring burden, debugging complexity, incident response?
- [ ] **Business Risks**: Service disruption, data loss, user impact?
- [ ] **Scalability Limits**: Resource constraints, bottlenecks, capacity planning?

### Safety Mechanisms

- [ ] **Rollback Strategy**: Can rollback within 5 minutes?
  - [ ] Failure scenarios documented
  - [ ] Recovery procedure tested
  - [ ] Data consistency ensured

- [ ] **Monitoring Plan**: How will we detect issues early?
  - [ ] Key metrics defined
  - [ ] Alerts configured
  - [ ] Anomaly detection ready

- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: Partial failure = core functionality maintained?
  - [ ] Circuit breaker pattern (if applicable)
  - [ ] Fallback mechanisms
  - [ ] User impact minimized

### Progressive Enhancement

- [ ] **Phase 1** (10%): Minimal feature for risk validation
- [ ] **Phase 2** (30%): Expanded application for performance validation
- [ ] **Phase 3** (100%): Full deployment after stability confirmation

**Or**: Single-phase deployment justified because: ___________________________
