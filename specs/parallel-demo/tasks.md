## Dependencies
- Setup: No dependencies
- Foundational: Depends on Setup
- User Story 1: Depends on Foundational
- User Story 2: Depends on Foundational (can run parallel to US1)
- Polish: Depends on all stories

## Parallel Opportunities
Tasks marked with [P] can execute in parallel within their phase:
- Phase 1: T002, T003, T004 (3 parallel)
- Phase 2: T006, T007 (2 parallel)
- Phase 3: T008, T009, T010 (3 parallel)
- Phase 4: T013, T014, T015 (3 parallel)
- Phase 5: T018, T019, T020 (3 parallel)

**Total: 14 parallel tasks out of 21 = 66% parallelization**
**Expected speedup: ~2.5x**
