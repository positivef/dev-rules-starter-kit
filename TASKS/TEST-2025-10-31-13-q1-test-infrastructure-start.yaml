lessons_learned:
  1_git_stash_danger:
    issue: "Integration tests lost in git stash"
    impact: "Had to recreate from scratch"
    prevention: "Commit more frequently, avoid complex stash operations"

  2_test_recreation_speed:
    observation: "Recreated 11 tests in ~10 minutes"
    reason: "Clear understanding of requirements from first attempt"
    lesson: "Previous work not wasted - learned what to test"

  3_basic_tests_value:
    finding: "Basic 'script exists' tests catch issues early"
    example: "Verify all 8 tools present and executable"
    value: "Foundation for deeper testing"

  4_subprocess_testing:
    approach: "Use subprocess.run() to test CLI tools"
    benefit: "Tests real execution, not just imports"
    limitation: "Slower than unit tests (17s for 18 tests)"
