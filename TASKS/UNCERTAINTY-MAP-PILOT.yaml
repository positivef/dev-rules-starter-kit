# ========================================
# Notes
# ========================================

notes: |
  This pilot is also a Pattern 2 test:
  - User proposed unverified idea (10 items)
  - AI did NOT reject
  - AI proposed 2-Track validation
  - AI will make data-driven decision

  If RICE_10 < RICE_3, we KEEP 3 items (validated by data)
  If RICE_10 > RICE_3, we ADOPT 10 items (validated by data)

  Either outcome validates Pattern 2:
  - We didn't reject unverified idea
  - We validated with data
  - We made evidence-based decision
