  Remove 8 deprecated and duplicate test files (36KB) that were moved to
  tests/ directory or replaced by P10 UTF-8 handling.

  Cleanup targets:
  - 7 test files moved to tests/ with advanced versions
  - 1 deprecated encoding handler replaced by P10

  P14 Analysis:
  - Technical Risk: Low (tests/ has latest versions)
  - Rollback: Git provides instant recovery
  - Safety: No production code affected

acceptance_criteria:
  - "8 files successfully removed from scripts/"
  - "tests/ directory contains equivalent or better versions"
  - "No broken imports or dependencies"
  - "P10 UTF-8 handling confirmed as replacement"
  - "Git history preserved for rollback"
