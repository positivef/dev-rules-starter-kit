# Dev Rules Starter Kit: Solution Overview & Improvement Backlog

## Executive Summary
- **Project Identity**: Reusable starter kit that packages the constitution-driven "Executable Knowledge Base" system proven in DoubleDiver.
- **Primary Intent**: Enforce development governance via YAML contracts, automated evidence capture, and knowledge asset synchronization (e.g., Obsidian) rather than acting as a generic quality dashboard.
- **Guiding Principles**: Constitution-first decisions, documentation-as-code, and evidence-backed knowledge accumulation across the seven-layer architecture (Constitution → Execution → Analysis → Optimization → Evidence → Knowledge Asset → Visualization).

## Confirmed Solution Scope
1. **Constitution Anchoring**
   - NORTH_STAR.md is the pre-work compass to align every task with the constitution and system architecture.
   - Constitutional articles (P1–P13) define governance rules from YAML-first execution to auditability, tests, security, and ROI transparency.
2. **Operational Workflow**
   - Contract authoring → TaskExecutor automation → DeepAnalyzer verification → Evidence logging → Obsidian sync → Dashboard review.
   - Emphasizes reproducible, evidence-backed assets instead of bespoke tooling.
3. **Expected ROI**
   - Initial ~7 hour setup yields an estimated 22 hours saved per month (≈264 hours per year) via automation and standardization.

## Improvement Backlog for ClaudeCode CLI Verification
| Priority | Area | Gap / Risk | Recommendation | Relevant Artifacts |
|----------|------|------------|----------------|--------------------|
| P0 | Constitution Traceability | Lack of quick reference mapping between constitution articles and supporting tooling may slow audits. | Add a `docs/constitution-mapping.md` that lists each article, enforcing tools, and integration checkpoints. | `NORTH_STAR.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md`
| P1 | Evidence Automation | Need validation that TaskExecutor + DeepAnalyzer output is being captured consistently. | Implement CI check to ensure every completed task generates evidence entries in `RUNS/` with timestamps. | `RUNS/`, `scripts/`
| P1 | Knowledge Asset Sync | Obsidian sync steps are implicitly described but not scripted. | Provide automation script (e.g., `scripts/sync_obsidian.sh`) with environment variables documented. | `docs/`, `scripts/`
| P2 | Dashboard Scope Discipline | Risk of scope creep toward “dashboard polish” contrary to principles. | Add decision checklist to `docs/guardrails/` enforcing scope boundaries before approving visualization tasks. | `docs/`
| P2 | ROI Tracking | ROI projection exists but lacks validation loop. | Introduce monthly retrospective template capturing actual hours saved vs projected. | `docs/templates/`

## Next Steps for ClaudeCode CLI
1. **Confirm Presence of This Backlog**: Ensure CLI surfaces `claudedocs/project_analysis.md` during analysis workflows.
2. **Create Follow-up Tasks**: Generate structured tasks for each P0/P1 item in the `TASKS/` directory with YAML contracts aligned to relevant constitutional articles.
3. **Schedule Automation Enhancements**: Queue development of CI checks and sync scripts with explicit evidence capture to maintain the executable knowledge system.
