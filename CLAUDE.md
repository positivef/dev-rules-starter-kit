# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Dev Rules Starter Kit is a **Constitution-Based Development Framework** implementing an executable knowledge base system. YAML contracts are executed through TaskExecutor to create self-documenting, evidence-based development workflows.

### Core Philosophy
- **Constitution-Centric**: 13 articles (P1-P13) define all development principles
- **Executable Documentation**: YAML contracts → TaskExecutor → Evidence → Obsidian sync
- **7-Layer Architecture**: Each tool enforces specific constitutional articles

## Critical Rules ⚠️

### Windows Encoding - NEVER USE EMOJIS IN PYTHON CODE
```python
# WRONG - Will crash on Windows
print("✅ Task completed")
status = "🚀 Deploying"

# CORRECT - Use ASCII alternatives
print("[SUCCESS] Task completed")
status = "[DEPLOY] Deploying"
```

**Emoji Usage Rules**:
- ✅ Markdown files (.md)
- ✅ Git commit messages
- ❌ Python code (.py)
- ❌ YAML files
- ❌ Shell scripts

## Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Virtual environment (ALWAYS use venv)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

```

### Key Components

**Core Execution Pipeline**:
1. `task_executor.py` - Executes YAML contracts, enforces P1-P2
2. `constitutional_validator.py` - Validates compliance with all articles
3. `obsidian_bridge.py` - Syncs to Obsidian knowledge base (P3)
4. `context_provider.py` - Maintains session context

**Analysis & Validation**:
- `deep_analyzer.py` - SOLID principles, security, hallucination detection
- `team_stats_aggregator.py` - Calculates quality metrics
- `critical_file_detector.py` - Identifies high-impact files
- `verification_cache.py` - Caches validation results for performance

**Session & Context Management**:
- `session_manager.py` - Session state persistence (30min checkpoints)
- `context_aware_loader.py` - Resume with previous context
- `auto_context_tracker.py` - Automatic context tracking

**Advanced Features**:
- `enhanced_task_executor_v2.py` - Parallel execution with worker pools
- `tier1_cli.py` - Advanced CLI features (tag sync, dataview, mermaid, TDD)
- `principle_conflict_detector.py` - Detects constitutional conflicts (P11)

## Working with the System

### Creating New Features
1. **Define in YAML first** (P1):
   ```yaml
   # TASKS/FEAT-YYYY-MM-DD-XX.yaml
   task_id: "FEAT-2025-10-26-01"
   title: "Feature description"
   gates:
     - type: "constitutional"
       articles: ["P4", "P5"]
   commands:
     - exec: ["python", "scripts/implementation.py"]
   ```

2. **Validate plan then execute**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/task_executor.py TASKS/FEAT-2025-10-26-01.yaml --plan
   # Review plan then execute
   python scripts/task_executor.py TASKS/FEAT-2025-10-26-01.yaml
   ```

3. **Evidence auto-collected**: Saved to `RUNS/evidence/`
4. **Obsidian auto-sync**: Knowledge base updated within 3 seconds

### Security Gates
TaskExecutor enforces:
- Command whitelist (ALLOWED_CMDS)
- Risk pattern detection
- Environment variable filtering
- Secret detection (gitleaks)
- Port conflict checking
- Dependency verification

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: `tests/test_*.py`
- **Integration tests**: `tests/test_*_integration.py`
- **Coverage requirement**: ≥90%
- **Performance tests**: Marked with `@pytest.mark.benchmark`

### Git Workflow
```bash
# ALWAYS check status first
git status && git branch

# Feature branches only
git checkout -b tier1/feature-name

# Conventional Commits (enforced by pre-commit)
git commit -m "feat(scope): add new feature"
git commit -m "fix(scope): resolve issue"
git commit -m "docs(scope): update documentation"
```

## Context Persistence

```bash
# Initialize master configuration
python scripts/context_provider.py init

# Check current context
python scripts/context_provider.py get-context

# Resume session with context
python scripts/context_aware_loader.py --resume
```

**Context mechanism**:
- `config/master_config.json`: Central configuration store
- `RUNS/context/`: Per-session context snapshots
- Automatic context restoration on session start

## Obsidian Integration

### Configuration
Set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` in `.env`:
```bash
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=C:/Users/user/Documents/ObsidianVault
OBSIDIAN_ENABLED=true
PROJECT_NAME=MyProject
```

### Automatic Git Hook Sync (Installed)

**Status**: ✅ Installed and active

Auto-syncs to Obsidian on every commit when:
- 3+ files changed
- Feature commits (feat:, feature:, implement, add)
- Bug fixes (fix:, bug:, resolve)
- Refactoring (refactor:, cleanup)
- Documentation (docs:, analyze, analysis)

**Commands**:
```bash
# Check installation
python scripts/install_obsidian_auto_sync.py --check

# Reinstall if needed
python scripts/install_obsidian_auto_sync.py

# Uninstall
python scripts/install_obsidian_auto_sync.py --uninstall
```

**How it works**:
1. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "feat: add feature"`
2. Post-commit hook automatically runs
3. Development log created in `개발일지/YYYY-MM-DD_작업명.md`
4. No manual action needed

### Manual sync triggers
- TaskExecutor execution completion
- Major architectural changes

### Knowledge structure
- `개발일지/`: Daily development logs
- `TASKS/`: Task contract copies
- `MOCs/`: Knowledge maps (auto-updated)
- `evidence/`: Execution evidence links

## Critical Files (Impact Score >0.5)

Files requiring extra validation:
- `*_executor.py` - Core execution engines
- `*_validator.py` - Validation systems
- `constitutional_*.py` - Constitution enforcement tools
- `*_guard.py` - Security components
- `project_*.py` - Project steering
- `context_*.py` - Context management
- `obsidian_*.py` - Knowledge synchronization

## Development Philosophy

### NORTH_STAR.md Principles
1. **Constitution is Law** - All tools enforce specific articles
2. **Documentation = Code** - YAML contracts are executable
3. **Evidence > Assumptions** - All claims must be verifiable
4. **ROI-Focused** - 377% annual return on setup investment

### Anti-patterns to Avoid ❌
- Working directly on main/master branch
- Skipping YAML contracts for complex tasks
- Adding features without constitutional basis
- Focusing on UI over constitution compliance
- Creating isolated tools without article enforcement
- Using system Python without venv
- Ending sessions without context save
- **Using emojis in Python code**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
```bash
# Verify virtual environment is active
which python  # Should show .venv path (Linux/Mac)
where python  # Windows - should show .venv path

# Ruff not found
pip install ruff  # Run inside venv

# Obsidian sync failure
type .env | findstr OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH  # Windows
cat .env | grep OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH      # Linux/Mac
python scripts/obsidian_bridge.py test   # Test connection

# Context mismatch
python scripts/context_provider.py diagnose  # Run diagnostics

# Pre-commit hooks not running
pre-commit install

# Windows encoding errors
# Set environment variable: PYTHONUTF8=1
# Or add to scripts: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```

### Performance Optimization
- VerificationCache reduces duplicate checks by 60%
- WorkerPool for parallel execution
- Smart cache with 5-minute TTL
- Critical file detection for focused verification
- Context hash for fast consistency checks

## Latest Updates (2025-10-29)
- **TaskExecutor internal commands**: write_file, eplace, un_shell_command are now handled via INTERNAL_FUNCTIONS and ALLOWED_SHELL_CMDS. Use dictionaries for internal args and lists for shell args.
- **Collaboration locks**: scripts/agent_sync.py manages per-agent locks; TaskExecutor auto-acquires/releases locks based on contract evidence/commands. Check dev-context/agent_sync_state.json for gents + locks entries.
- **multi_agent_sync**: reads/writes the new state format and keeps _LATEST_LOCKS in sync. Never overwrite the locks array manually.
- **Enhanced Task Executor v2**: provides _parse_task_line, _execute_sequential_tasks, _generate_evidence, _calculate_statistics, and passes 	ests/test_enhanced_task_executor_v2.py. Use EnhancedTaskExecutorV2 for compatibility with older tooling.
- **Validation**: python -m pytest -q tests/test_enhanced_task_executor_v2.py covers the executor API; rerun after touching execution logic.

- **Preflight check**: run python scripts/preflight_checks.py before handoff or major merges to execute 	ests/test_enhanced_task_executor_v2.py automatically.

- **Lock status CLI**: use python scripts/agent_sync_status.py to list active locks or python scripts/agent_sync_status.py --agent codex --task TASK-123 --files src/app.py to preflight conflicts.
