  Verify MCP Server integration and Academic Verification system (5 DBs)
  as part of Phase 1 critical components that were discovered missing
  from documentation during morning review.

  Context:
  - User flow analysis showed 67% Playwright usage rate
  - Academic verification used in /dev command Stage 3
  - Part of Scenario B+ execution with P15 informative approach

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Academic Verification: 3/5 DBs operational (Semantic Scholar, arXiv, Crossref)"
  - "Confidence scores: 80%+ for test queries"
  - "Cache hit rate: >50%"
  - "Playwright 1.55.0+ installed and accessible"
  - "Dev Rules MCP Server (FastMCP) verified"
  - "Python 3.13.0+ environment confirmed"
