# Hybrid Resolution Risk Analysis & Mitigation

## Innovation Safety Assessment

### Proposed Change
Add confidence-based hybrid resolution to UnifiedErrorResolver:
- High confidence (>=90%): Auto-apply
- Medium confidence (50-90%): Ask user confirmation
- Low confidence (<50%): User intervention

## Risk Assessment Checklist

### 1. Technical Risks

#### Risk 1.1: Confidence Calculation Errors
**Severity**: HIGH
**Probability**: MEDIUM

**Scenario**: Confidence score incorrectly calculated as HIGH (95%) when should be MEDIUM (60%)
- Wrong auto-application of dangerous command
- User trust broken
- Potential system damage

**Mitigation**:
- **Conservative defaults**: Start with lower base scores (70% instead of 80%)
- **Whitelist approach**: Only boost confidence for known-safe patterns
- **Blacklist dangerous patterns**: Auto-penalize sudo, rm, database operations
- **Circuit breaker**: After 3 wrong auto-applications, disable auto-apply for session
- **Logging**: Track all confidence decisions for post-mortem analysis

**Rollback**: Set `auto_apply_threshold: 1.0` (disable auto-apply entirely)

#### Risk 1.2: Increased Complexity
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: HIGH

**Scenario**: Code becomes harder to maintain and debug
- More branches in decision tree
- Confidence calculation logic opaque
- Harder to troubleshoot failures

**Mitigation**:
- **Clear separation**: ConfidenceCalculator as separate class
- **Extensive logging**: Every decision logged with reasoning
- **Unit tests**: 100% coverage for confidence calculation
- **Documentation**: Decision tree diagrams in code comments

**Rollback**: Set `mode: "simple"` in config to use old Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3

#### Risk 1.3: Performance Impact
**Severity**: LOW
**Probability**: LOW

**Scenario**: Confidence calculation adds latency
- Regex matching overhead
- Config file loading delays

**Mitigation**:
- **Caching**: Cache config file in memory
- **Lazy loading**: Only calculate confidence when needed
- **Benchmark**: Target <5ms for confidence calculation
- **Early exit**: Skip calculation if pattern obviously high/low confidence

**Measurement**: Add timing metrics to confidence calculation

---

### 2. Operational Risks

#### Risk 2.1: Confirmation Fatigue
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: HIGH

**Scenario**: Too many MEDIUM confidence prompts annoy user
- User develops "yes bias" (always click yes without reading)
- Defeats purpose of confirmation
- User frustration

**Mitigation**:
- **Adaptive thresholds**: If user says "yes" 10 times in row, auto-boost that pattern
- **Pattern learning**: Track user confirmations to adjust confidence
- **Batch confirmations**: Group similar confirmations
- **Smart defaults**: Pre-select "yes" for repeated patterns

**Monitoring**: Track confirmation rate, yes/no ratio per session

#### Risk 2.2: Debugging Complexity
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: MEDIUM

**Scenario**: Hard to understand why certain confidence score was given
- "Why did it auto-apply this but ask about that?"
- Opaque decision making

**Mitigation**:
- **Explainable confidence**: Show calculation breakdown
  ```
  Confidence: 85%
  - Base pattern match: 70%
  - pip install bonus: +10%
  - Official source bonus: +5%
  ```
- **Debug mode**: `--debug-confidence` flag shows all calculations
- **Decision log**: Save all confidence decisions to file

**Implementation**: Add `explain=True` parameter to confidence calculation

#### Risk 2.3: Monitoring Overhead
**Severity**: LOW
**Probability**: MEDIUM

**Scenario**: Too much logging/statistics slows system
- Every confidence calculation logged
- Statistics tracking overhead

**Mitigation**:
- **Sampling**: Only log 10% of decisions in production
- **Async logging**: Non-blocking background logging
- **Configurable**: `logging_level: minimal|normal|verbose`

---

### 3. Business Risks

#### Risk 3.1: User Trust Damage
**Severity**: HIGH
**Probability**: LOW

**Scenario**: Auto-applied solution breaks something important
- Production database altered
- Files deleted
- Services disrupted

**Mitigation**:
- **Conservative confidence**: Err on side of asking user
- **Dangerous pattern blacklist**: Never auto-apply:
  - `sudo`, `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, `delete from`
  - Production environment operations
  - Payment/auth system changes
- **Dry-run mode**: Show what would be done before doing it
- **Undo capability**: Save state before applying solution

**Circuit Breaker**: After 1 bad auto-application, require confirmation for 10 next operations

#### Risk 3.2: False Sense of Security
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: MEDIUM

**Scenario**: User trusts "95% confidence" too much
- Assumes it's always right
- Stops reviewing solutions
- Misses edge cases

**Mitigation**:
- **Transparency**: Always show the actual solution being applied
- **Education**: Help text explains confidence is heuristic, not guarantee
- **User control**: Easy override/cancel mechanism
- **Feedback loop**: "Was this solution correct? (Y/n)" after application

---

### 4. Scalability Risks

#### Risk 4.1: Config File Grows Too Large
**Severity**: LOW
**Probability**: HIGH

**Scenario**: Pattern lists become unwieldy
- 100+ whitelist patterns
- 50+ blacklist patterns
- Hard to maintain

**Mitigation**:
- **Pattern categories**: Group by domain (python, js, system)
- **Regex patterns**: Use regex instead of explicit lists
- **Hierarchical config**: Break into multiple files
- **Auto-pruning**: Remove unused patterns after 30 days

**Limit**: Max 50 patterns per category

#### Risk 4.2: Confidence Drift
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: MEDIUM

**Scenario**: Confidence scores become less accurate over time
- Libraries evolve
- Error patterns change
- Stale patterns in whitelist

**Mitigation**:
- **Version tracking**: Link confidence rules to library versions
- **Expiration dates**: Patterns expire after 6 months unless renewed
- **Validation metrics**: Track accuracy rate over time
- **Periodic review**: Monthly confidence accuracy audit

**Monitoring**: Track confidence accuracy: (correct auto-applies / total auto-applies)

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (< 1 minute)

**Option 1: Config-based disable**
```yaml
# config/error_resolution_config.yaml
mode: "simple"  # Revert to original Tier 1 → 2 → 3
```

**Option 2: Threshold adjustment**
```yaml
confidence_thresholds:
  auto_apply: 1.0  # Disable auto-apply (impossible to reach)
```

**Option 3: Git revert**
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Partial Rollback

Disable specific risky features while keeping safe ones:
```yaml
auto_apply_patterns: []  # Clear whitelist
always_confirm_patterns: ["*"]  # Confirm everything
```

---

## Circuit Breaker Mechanism

### Auto-Disable Triggers

**Trigger 1: Error Rate**
- 3 wrong auto-applications in 10 attempts
- Action: Disable auto-apply for current session
- Recovery: Manual re-enable or next session

**Trigger 2: User Rejections**
- User says "no" to 5 MEDIUM confirmations in a row
- Action: Boost threshold to 95% (more conservative)
- Recovery: Gradually lower threshold as accuracy improves

**Trigger 3: System Impact**
- Any auto-applied solution causes service failure
- Action: Immediate disable + alert
- Recovery: Manual investigation required

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics

```yaml
confidence_metrics:
  accuracy_rate:
    target: ">95%"
    alert_threshold: "<90%"

  auto_apply_rate:
    target: "20-30%"  # Not too few, not too many
    alert_threshold: "<10% or >50%"

  confirmation_yes_rate:
    target: "60-80%"  # Balanced
    alert_threshold: ">90%"  # Confirmation fatigue

  average_confidence:
    target: "0.75-0.85"
    alert_threshold: ">0.90"  # Too confident
```

### Dashboard

Track in real-time:
- Confidence distribution histogram
- Accuracy rate by pattern type
- User confirmation behavior
- Circuit breaker activations

## Progressive Enhancement Strategy

### Phase 1: Conservative Launch (Week 1)
```yaml
auto_apply: 0.95  # Very high threshold
ask_confirm: 0.80  # High threshold
```
- Only most obvious cases auto-applied
- Gather accuracy data
- Build user trust

### Phase 2: Calibration (Week 2-3)
```yaml
auto_apply: 0.92  # Slightly lower
ask_confirm: 0.70  # More confirmations
```
- Analyze Phase 1 accuracy
- Adjust thresholds based on data
- Add proven patterns to whitelist

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 4+)
```yaml
auto_apply: 0.90  # Target threshold
ask_confirm: 0.50  # Final threshold
```
- Full hybrid operation
- Continuous monitoring
- Adaptive adjustments

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Alternative A: Machine Learning Confidence
**Pros**: More accurate over time, learns from corrections
**Cons**: Requires training data, opaque decisions, complexity
**Decision**: Too complex for MVP, consider for v2.0

### Alternative B: User Preference Learning
**Pros**: Personalized to each user
**Cons**: Different users have different patterns, hard to generalize
**Decision**: Add as optional feature later

### Alternative C: Time-based Progressive Auto-Apply
**Pros**: Safe gradual rollout
**Cons**: Slow to reach full automation
**Decision**: Combine with confidence-based (use both)

### Alternative D: Pattern Voting System
**Pros**: Community-driven confidence scores
**Cons**: Requires multiple users, coordination overhead
**Decision**: Not applicable for single-user system

**Selected**: Confidence-based (C) + Progressive Enhancement (A aspects)
