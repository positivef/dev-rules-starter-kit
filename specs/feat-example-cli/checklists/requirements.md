# Specification Quality Checklist: Simple CLI Calculator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness before implementation
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [[spec.md|Simple CLI Calculator]]

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified (division by zero, invalid input)
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded (basic operations only)
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified (Python 3.10+)

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes (< 100ms, clear errors, help text)
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Constitutional Compliance Preview

- [X] Test-First approach planned (tests before implementation in tasks.md)
- [X] Library-First design (calculator module + CLI wrapper)
- [X] CLI interface mandatory (argparse-based)
- [X] Simplicity maintained (1 project, no over-engineering)
- [X] No emoji in specification or planned code

## Notes

[PASS] **All checks passed** - Ready for implementation with EnhancedTaskExecutor

**Next Step**: Run constitutional validator to confirm compliance
```bash
python scripts/constitutional_validator.py specs/feat-example-cli/tasks.md
```
